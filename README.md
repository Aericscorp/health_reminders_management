There are already many management and reminders apps out there, so this one may not appear as a win at first sight.

It can be an app for self-management that would be helpful during a doctor consultation. But there’s potential demand for extending the adoption of the app to full doctor-patient communication. Such app could enable seamless scheduling and managing patient’s prescriptions, and monitoring medication dosages. It could offer an integration with a pharmacy, and as most of the chains already have their eCommerce infrastructure, it can allow for quicker order handling and prompt delivery of the meds to the patient.
